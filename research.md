## Contiguous Graph Partitions with Swapping

<br />In the summer of 2018, I participated in the Computational Geometry research group in the Tufts CS department, NSF REU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Experiences_for_Undergraduates) grant. I worked with [Diane Souvaine](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~dls/), [Csaba Toth](http://csabatoth.org/), [Hugo Akitaya](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~halves01/), and some other undergraduates, to characterized how graph partitions may or may not transition from one configuration to another, via one vertex swapping. A paper with our results is currently being reviewed for publication. We also did literature review and discussion of a couple other problems, like online TSPN and certain graph embeddings.

## [Zoom Video Compression using a Truncated Tensor Singular Value Decomposition](research/DISCposter.pptx)

<br />The increasing ubiquity of video applications has placed new demands on methods of data storage, transmission, and processing. Specifically, video information can be very memory and computationally intensive, while applications demand faster speeds and more efficient storage. This poster presents the utility of a multilinear tensor approach to compressing zooming video. This is an extension of the use of tensor singular value decompositions (tSVD) beyond classification and recognition problems to approximate large amounts of multi-linear data. I also discuss methods and trade-offs of generalizing a typical compressed Singular Value Decomposition into the tensor class. Lastly, I demonstrate some of these options on sample video to show how memory-savings compare to losses in quality. I ultimately found that memory use can decrease by an order of magnitude, while significantly preserving picture quality. My mentor was [Misha Kilmer](http://emerald.tufts.edu/~mkilme01/).

## [Investigation of Reconstructive Operators for Compton-Scattering Tomography](research/TomographyArticle.pdf)

<br />In this project I designed, tested, and analyzed backprojective and reconstruction operators for Compton-Scattering Tomography. First, I generated data representative of such scans, and then coded-up and ran different reconstruction operators. I then compared the produced images, sought mathematical explanations for my results, and consulted with my advisor, [Todd Quinto](http://math.tufts.edu/faculty/equinto/). With his feedback, I iterated on previous attempts to try to eliminate numerical noise and reconstructive artifacts. While I wasnâ€™t always completely successful, I did make progress, and in some cases improved on traditional methods of reconstruction.
