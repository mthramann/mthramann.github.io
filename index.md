# About Mike

<br />Hi, I'm Michael Thramann. I just finished my bachelor's at Tufts University, double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I spent one semester at [St. Catherine's College](https://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/), Oxford as a visiting student in Computer Science. This summer, I'll be starting as an [Engineering Resident](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/engres.html) at Google in New York.

<br />In the past I've worked on several funded research projects (both math and CS), including an NSF REU. For more information regarding my research, see my [research page](/research).
