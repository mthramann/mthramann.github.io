# About Mike

<br />Hi, I'm Michael Thramann. I'm a rising senior at Tufts University (BS 2020) studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. When I'm not in class, I'm usually training in the gym as a member of the Tufts varsity crew team, or doing work for [other endeavors](/projects.html). You can find my [resume here](/resume.pdf).

<br />This past summer, I interned as a software engineer at [Ab Initio](https://www.abinitio.com/en/) in Lexington, MA. I really enjoyed the experience, and I got to work on a couple really cool projects. Before I started my internship, I had the privilege of studying at St. Catherine's College, Oxford University, as a visiting student in Computer Science. I met some very brilliant people, and learned a lot too.

<br />I'm currently involved in a research group that does very large-scale data processing for urban development and civil engineering research. In the past I've worked on several other funded research projects (both math and CS), including an NSF REU. For more information regarding my research, see my [research page](/research.html).

<br />I'm interested in full-time SWE roles in the Bos-Wash corridor. I can be reached [here](mailto:mthramann@gmail.com) if you're hiring.
