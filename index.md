# About Mike

<br />Hi, I'm Michael Thramann. I'm a rising senior at Tufts University (BS 2020) studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. When I'm not in class, I'm usually training in the gym as a member of the Tufts varsity crew team, on the tennis courts playing for the Club Tennis team, or doing work for [other endeavors](/projects). You can find my [resume here](/resume.pdf).

<br />This past summer, I interned as a software engineer at [Ab Initio](https://www.abinitio.com/en/) in Lexington, MA. I really enjoyed software development, and I got to complete some really cool projects. Before I started my internship, I had the privilege of studying at St. Catherine's College, Oxford University, as a visiting student in Computer Science. I met some very brilliant people, and learned a lot too.

<br />In the past I've worked on several funded research projects (both math and CS), including an NSF REU. For more information regarding my research, see my [research page](/research).

<br />I'll be starting as an Engineering Resident at Google in July 2020. I can be reached [here](mailto:mthramann@gmail.com).
