      <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Mike.</p>

<p>I'm currently a SWE at Jump Trading working on research and trading systems.</p>

<p>I was previously at Google working on their planetary-scale data indexing service.</p>

<p>I got my bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at <a href=https://www.tufts.edu>Tufts University</a>. In 2019 I studied abroad at <a href="https://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk">St. Catherine's College</a>, Oxford as a visiting student in Computer Science.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate, I worked on a <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgt.22856>graph theory paper</a> as part of an <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517>NSF REU</a> in the <a href=http://www.cs.tufts.edu/r/geometry/research.php>Tufts Computational Geometry Group</a>. Before that, I worked as a research assistant for a couple of mathematics professors.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get in touch, please <a href=mailto:mthramann@gmail.com>drop me an email</a>.</p>
