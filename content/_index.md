Hi, I'm Mike.

I'm currently a SWE at Jump Trading working on research and trading systems.

I was previously at Google working on their planetary-scale data indexing service.

I got my bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/). In 2019 I studied abroad at [St. Catherine's College](https://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/), Oxford as a visiting student in Computer Science.

As an undergraduate, I worked on a [graph theory paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgt.22856) as part of an [NSF REU](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517) in the [Tufts Computational Geometry Group](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/r/geometry/research.php). Before that, I worked as a research assistant for a couple of mathematics professors.

If you'd like to get in touch, please [drop me an email](mailto:mthramann@gmail.com).
